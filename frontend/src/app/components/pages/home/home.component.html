        We are thrilled that you are thinking of adopting a pet from us! <br>
        Our staff are available to assist you with any questions you may have and to give you as much information about our homeless pets as possible. We have a great deal of expertise on hand and we will try to match you with the best pet for you. <br><br>
        PLEASE NOTE:  Animals are not adopted out on the same day as your first visit.  An appointment will be made with you for a suitable day to take your pet home.
        Due to the numbers of animals that we receive each week, it isnâ€™t possible to feature all of them in our list of pets needing homes. <br><br>
        We would be delighted to have you visit the shelter Monday to Friday 10.00am to 5.30pm, Saturday & Sunday from 11.00am to 3.30pm so you can see all the animals we have for adoption.
